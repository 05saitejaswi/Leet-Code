/*
Question was:
I have 2 lists:
1st list have ID and FirstName
2nd list have ID and LastName

How should I join these lists, he asked me to tell how I would code, not write anything, my first thought was using a hashtable, puting all the first list on it, and then for the second list I would just get the ID and retrieve the LastName, if it was available.

He accepted the answer, but gave me a follow up:

What if I didn't have enough space to store the first list?

How would you guys do it?

And is it just me, or they are not asking us to code in the Phone screen anymore?
