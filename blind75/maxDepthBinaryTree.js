/*
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3

 use recursive DFS to find max depth (return + 1)
 TC- O(n)
 SC- O(n)
