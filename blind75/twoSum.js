/*
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

 g- return index of two nums that sum total to target

 i- array (numbers) - unsorted
 o- array (2 numbers) of index location of input arr
 se- n/a
 c- O(n2) exponential
    input arr length?, nums[i] limit?, target limit?
    only one answer exists.
 ec- input arr length = 0, neg nums,
